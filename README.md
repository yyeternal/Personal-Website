# Languages and Frameworks 

I used React, JS, HTML, and CSS to create this website 

# Purpose 

This is a portfolio website that I created in freshman year of college to display information about me and a way for recruiters to get to know who I am. It was deployed on Github pages and it was a way for me to get into web development and learn React.
